// When you use var, you can declare the same variable as many times as you like, but with let you can't.
// The following would work:
var myName = 'Chris';
var myName = 'Bob';

// But the following would throw an error on the second line:
// let myName = 'Chris';
// let myName = 'Bob';

// You'd have to do this instead:
// let myName = 'Chris';
// myName = 'Bob';
